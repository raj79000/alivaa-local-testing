    </p>



    <h4 className="h4">

    <b>Understanding the Gurugram Hotel Scene</b></h4>

<h4 className="h4" style={{fontSize: "14px", textTransform: "uppercase"}}>

    <b>Timing is Everything</b></h4>



<p>Time also plays a crucial role in ensuring great hotel deals in Gurugram. Hotel prices in the city change depending on the season, day of the week, as well as the time of the day. For example, business hotels that are situated in Gurugram have higher rates on weekdays due to high flow of business travellers. One of the ways to ensure that you get the best rates is by booking for the room either during a weekend or during low or off seasons. 

    </p>





<h4 className="h4" style={{fontSize: "14px", textTransform: "uppercase"}}>

 <b>Leverage Online Travel Platforms</b></h4>



<p>Some of the major internet ventures, like Expedia and Booking.com, are invaluable tools for finding hotel deals in Gurugram. The travel sites of Yatra, Goibibo, and MakeMyTrip are very helpful while searching for the hotel deals in Gurugram. Such websites may include extra costs, predominantly if you are booking during the holidays or right before the actual trip. Moreover, one can register for their newsletter to have the opportunity to know the latest offers and promotions from these platforms and, therefore, guarantee the lowest price for the selected hotel. </p>







<h4 className="h4" style={{fontSize: "14px", textTransform: "uppercase"}}>

 <b>Compare Prices Across Multiple Sites</b></h4>



<p>Since it is important to make a comparison so that one can be certain of getting the best deal, it is advised to cross-check the rates from one portal to another. It is also possible to meet the identical hotel at different sites with different tariffs and special offers. Another way is to use price comparison offers, or one can also browse directly to the chain’s website and check if there are direct booking offers anywhere. Sometimes, hotels are known to offer extra perks such as free breakfast, an upgrade to a better room, or a late checkout for guests when booked directly with the hotel online.
